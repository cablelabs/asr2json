        "The actual due date may be different from that desired because of factors such as the availability of facilities and the quantity, complexity, and impact on local service of the circuit(s) involved.",
        "On disconnect requests, this date represents the date billing is to stop on the involved circuit(s) and can be no earlier than the date the request is received by the provider.",
        "When different due dates are required, these dates are stipulated using a separate request for each desired due date.  For example, a total of 50 circuits are desired and the customer wants them at a rate of 10 per day.  Therefore, five ASR forms may be submitted stipulating this requirement.",
        "When multiple ASRs are associated with one Translation Questionnaire, all DDDs must be identical."

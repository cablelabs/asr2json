        "To accommodate the ordering of trunks to an Access Tandem when it is required to ad j ust the quantity due to an overflow occurrence, a zero w ould be used in this field for customers not allowed to order in trunks.  The number of trunks w ould be specified in REMARKS and a \"B\" would be entered in the \"UNIT\" field. ",
        "When a \"B\" or a \"C\" is entered in the UNIT field and a \"3\" (two way) is entered in the TTT field on the Trunking Form then two traffic types may be specified in the TRFTYP field on the Trunkin g Form.  ",
        "If more than one access circuit or facility is involved, the circuits must have identical transmission and switching characteristics. Furthermore, all of the request information ( including the desired due date ) , except for the circuit IDs, must be the same for all circuits involved. ",
        "If this order is a change, rearrangement or add of  a leg to a multipoint circuit  ( no change in circuit quantity )  then the customer will enter a one  ( 1 )  in this field.   ( NSL entry will indicate the number of legs with activity.)  ",
        "On a new request for additional QTY or on  a disconnect request for reducing the existing QTY, only the amount to be added or disconnected should be entered here.  On a supplement to change the QTY on a pending order, the entire ne w  desired QTY should be entered here.   In the latter case, a description of what the customer wants done is required in the REMARKS field. For example, if a customer has 10 circuits working and wished to remove 3 of them, the y  should send in a disconnect request for 3 circuits (QTY%3D3).  If, on the other hand, the customer places an order for 10 circuits and then decides they don't want 3 of them before the order is completed, they should send in a supplement to the original ne w  request that shows the new QTY desired, i.e., 7 circuits (QTY%3D7). ",
        "A multipoint circuit is considered to be one circuit. Only 1 multipoint circuit may be requested per Access Service Request, as interpreted herein. 8%3A QTY must be equal to one  ( 1 )  if NVC on the Transport or EUSA Form is greater than zero  ( 0 ) . ( NVC entry on the service specific form will indicate the number of VC with activity). 9%3A QTY must be equal to one  ( 1 )  when the EVCI field is populated. (NUT field on the EVC form will indicate the number of UNI terminations with activity). "

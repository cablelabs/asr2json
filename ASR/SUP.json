A new request is then issued with the new ASC-EC.   2  %3D  New Due Date - Indicates a change to the Desired Due Date  ( DDD )  and any associated fields as defined by provider customer negotiations. \nThe new DDD may not exceed the limits defined in Provider Access Tariff/practices.

Therefore, when the ASC-EC field is populated with an ICSC code other than that of the receiving provider, the receipt of a SUP \"3\" must be acceptable as the initial ASR to the added OEC.  4  %3D  Correction - Indicates that this request is being issued to correct a previous request that has not already been confirmed by the provider.  \nValid for Firm Orders when the ASR has not been confirmed by the provider. \nValid for Service Requests  ( Inquiry )  whether or not the ASR has been confirmed by the provider.  \nIn a Multi-EC environment, the use of a SUP type \"4\" is to be based on the status of the ASC-EC FOC.

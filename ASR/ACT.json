    "validEntryNotes": " If the modification is exclusively an inside or outside move, an ACT of \"M\" or \"T\" respectively must be used, with the exception of multipoint services. \nWhen the second position of the TQ field is \"N\" or \"X\", the ACT field entry must be \"C\" or \"R\". \nUse of \"C\" is based on provider  tariffs/contracts/negotiations. \n\"C\" may not be used to migrate to or from Unbundled Network Elements. \n\"C\" is prohibited for Combination Ethernet Virtual Connection (EVCI %3D \"B\") services.  D  %3D  Disconnection or decrease in capacity  M %3D Inside move of the physical termination within  a building \nInside move excludes deregulated inside wire. \n\"M\" is prohibited for multipoint, broadband (REQTYP %3D \"V\") and Ethernet Virtual Connection (EVCI %3D \"A\", \"B\") services.   N  %3D  New installation or increase in capacity.  R  %3D  Record activity is for ordering administrative changes. \nA billing account number change is not supported  by the ASR.  Such requests are to be processed  using provider procedures. \nAdministrative changes may be chargeable under provider tariffs. \nWhen the second position of the TQ field is \"N\" or \"X\", the ACT field entry must be \"C\" or \"R\". \nWhen the EOD USE field on the EOD Form is \"A\", the ACT field entry must be \"R\".  T%3D  Outside move of end user location \n\"T\" is prohibited for Feature Group A, B, C, D, local trunking, multipoint, broadband (REQTYP %3D \"V\" )  and Ethernet Virtual Connection (EVCI %3D \"A\", \"B\" )  services.  \nSuch moves are permitted for special access and WATS Access lines when terminated at an end user location (other than an ACTL).  \nOutside moves are accommodated on a single customer order with the stipulation that the BAN ( Billing Account Number ) , the NC  ( Network Channel Code ) , ACTL  ( Access Customer Terminal Location ) and the ECCKT are provided and are the same as for the existing circuit being moved.  MULTIPOINT ORDERING%3A  Multipoint activity specific rules are covered in the following matrix describing the use of ACT as it relates to the LEGACT field on the MSL Form%3A  Type of Activit y ACT entry  LEGACT entry  New Connect  N  N  Complete Disconnect  D  D  Add Leg  C  N  Disconnect Leg  C  D  Inside Move Leg  C  M  Outside Move Leg  C  N %26 D *  Change Leg  C  C  Record R R  Cancel a Leg  K  * 2 MSLs required \nIf the disconnect of a Leg ( s )  on an existin g multipoint configuration causes it to change to  a  two point configuration, two ASRs may be required depending on provider procedures. If two ASRs are required, one would contain an ACT of \"D\" and the other \"N\". Use of the RPON field along with remarks would be necessary in an effort to be sure that there is no interruption of service. \nIf the customer wishes to cancel a request for a le g  or legs of a multipoint configuration, the LEGAC Tof \"K\" will be used.  However, if the cancellation causes it to change to a two-point configuration, the original request should be cancelled and a ne w request submitted for the two-point configuration.  RING ORDERING%3A  Ring activity specific rules are covered in the following matrix describing the use of ACT as it relates to the SEGACT field on the RING or ARI Form%3A  Type of Activit y ACT entry  SEGACT entry  New Connect  N  N/A  Complete Disconnect  D  N/A  Add Segment*  C  N  Disconnect Segment*  C  D  Inside Move Segment  N/A  N/A  Outside Move Segment  N/A  N/A  Node allocation change  C  C  Recap of Segment  C  R  *Adding and disconnecting segments supports the \"move\" activities  VIRTUAL CONNECTION ORDERING%3A  Virtual Connection activity specific rules are covered in the following matri x describing the use of ACT as it relates to the VCACT field on the VC Form%3A  Type of Activit y ACT entry  VCACT entry  New NNI/UNI  with  VC N N  Complete Disconnect  D  D  Add VC  C  N  Disconnect VC  C  D  Inside Move of /UNI  M  C or R  Outside Move of /UNI  T  C or N  Change VC  C  C  Record Activity  R  R  Cancel a VC  K \nIf the customer wishes to cancel a request for a VC, the VCACT of \"K\" will be used.  ETHERNET VIRTUAL CONNECTION ORDERING%3A  Ethernet Virtual Connection activity specific rules are covered in the following matrix describing the use of ACT as it relates to the UACT and LOSACT fields on the EVC Form.  For a stand alone request the ASR ACT represents the activit y of the EVC/OVC.   For a combination request the ASR ACT represents the activit y of both the physical port and the EVC/OVC.  Type of Activit y ASR ACT   UACT  LOSACT  New Connect  N  N  N  Complete Disconnect of  EVC  D D  Add UNI Termination   C  1  N  N  Disconnect UNI/ENNI  Termination   C  1  D  Change EVC/OVC  (includes changes to a  UNI/ENNI termination)   C  1 N, C, D  N, C, D  Record Activity  R  R  Cancel UNI/ENNI Termination  N, C 1 , D, R K    Cancel a Level of  Service (LOS)   N, C 1 K   Inside Move Segment  N/A  N/A   N/A  Outside Move Segment  N/A  N/A  N/A \nIf the customer wishes to cancel a request for  a UNI/ENNI termination the UACT of \"K\" will be used. The UACT of \"K\" will imply that all LOS activity associated with the cancelled UNI/ENNI termination will also be cancelled.  1  Activity of \"C\" is not applicab le for a combination request.  \nIf the customer wishes to cancel a request for  a LOS, but the UNI/ENNI termination remains intact on the request, the LOSACT of \"K\" will be used.

Geopolitical Code– Positions 5 and 6 describe the designation of a state or territory of the United States, a province or territory of Canada, another country having a national federal government, or a unique designation (2 alpha characters). 3. Network Site Code – Positions 7 and 8 describe the designation of a site of an existing or proposed structure within a geographical location where there is a need to identify one or more telecommunications equipment entities, facility terminations, nodal locations, or administrative operations (2 alpha or 2 numeric characters). 4. Network Entity Code – Positions 9 through 11 describe the functional category of equipment or work center that is contained in a structure. Equipment categories, including central office switching and ancillary equipment or non-switching or access terminations, are associated with a building or network site for purposes of maintaining equipment inventories and for identifying facility and circuit terminations and nodal locations  (3 alpha/numeric characters)."

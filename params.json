{"name":"asr2json","tagline":"A converter that takes in ASR PDF Spec and produces JSON.","body":"# asr2json\r\n\r\n> **IMPORTANT**: This project is in pre-release development. Please expect frequent changes and updates while we converge on our initial release.\r\n\r\nasr2json is a converter that takes in the [ATIS](http://www.atis.org/) Access Service Ordering Guildlines (ASOG) PDF specification and produces JSON.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, asr2json converts Access Service Request (ASR) Form Preparation Guides in PDF format to JSON, similar to the following (represents a single field):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"asogVersion\": \"50\",\r\n  \"processed\": \"2015-07-14T18:25:43.511Z\",\r\n  \"form\": \"FORM\",\r\n  \"section\": \"SECTION\",\r\n  \"name\": \"Example Field Name\",\r\n  \"title\": \"EFN\",\r\n  \"fieldNumber\": \"001\",\r\n  \"fieldLength\": \"3\",\r\n  \"characteristics\": \"Alpha\",\r\n  \"usage\": \"Required\",\r\n  \"example\": \"ABC\",\r\n  \"definition\": \"An exmaple field that serves as an example for this example.\",\r\n  \"validEntry\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": \"ABC\",\r\n      \"description\": \"One example.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"value\": \"XYZ\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Another example.\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"validEntryNotes\": [\r\n    \"Any three character alpha string.\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"usageNotes\": [\r\n    \"A usage note.\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"fieldNotes\": [\r\n    \"A general field note.\",\r\n    \"Another field note about how this field relates to another field.\",\r\n    \"One last field note.\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"errors\": []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nasr2json is meant to convert valid copies of the [Access Service Ordering Guidelines (ASOG)](http://www.atis.org/obf/download.asp) that have been properly purchased from ATIS.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the converter, please visit the [asr2json wiki](https://github.com/cablelabs/asr2json/wiki).\r\n\r\n##Setup\r\n\r\n###Install Node.js\r\n\r\nTo check if Node.js is already installed or to check if it has been installed correctly:\r\n```\r\nnode -v\r\n```\r\nIf you're installing Node.js for the first time, please see: https://nodejs.org/\r\n\r\n###Install pdf2json module\r\n\r\nAt this time, you need to install the [pdf2json](https://github.com/modesty/pdf2json) module globally. This step should be shortlived as we plan to update asr2json to simply import the pdf2json moduled. For now, please use this command to install pdf2json globally:\r\n```\r\nsudo npm install pdf2json -g\r\n```\r\nTo check if pdf2json has been installed correctly:\r\n```\r\npdf2json -v\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Clone the repository\r\nUse the `cd` command to navigate to the desired directory. Clone the git repository (git required):\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/cablelabs/asr2json.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Run\r\n```\r\ncd asr2json\r\nnode index.js path-to-asr.pdf path-to-output-directory start-page stop-page \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the command to run asr2json from the terminal. Replace fileName with the name of the pdf containing the spec. Replace start-page and end-page with the pages from the pdf which you want to be converted.  A directory matching the form name will be created in the output directory specified, and that form directory will contain json files matching the field names.  The output directory will be created if it doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n##Require\r\nasr2json isn't published to npm, so to require it in node, you will need to clone the repo inside of your node_modules directory\r\n\r\nfrom within your project:\r\n```\r\ncd node_modules\r\ngit clone https://github.com/cablelabs/asr2json.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nin your nodejs file\r\n```\r\nvar asr2json = require('./node_modules/asr2json/index.js');\r\n\r\nasr2json('path-to-asr.pdf', 'path-to-output-directory', startPage, stopPage);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nasr2json was originally built by [CableLabs](http://cablelabs.com/), but we could use your help! Check out our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\r\n\r\n## Other important stuff\r\n\r\nWe use an [MIT License](https://github.com/cablelabs/asr2json/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\r\n\r\nQuestions?

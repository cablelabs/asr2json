The ASR Form with each of the entry fields numbered is depicted in 
Section 4 of this practice. These numbers correspond to the field 
definitions in Sections 3.1 – 3.3. Section 3.4 addresses the minimal input 
requirements for disconnect and record order activity. Section 3.5 
contains an alphabetic listing of the ASR Form fields cross referenced to 
the field numbers depicted in the numbered form. 
This form is prepared by the customer and is submitted to the ICSC for 
the ordering of service. The term “ICSC” (Interexchange Customer 
Service Center) referenced throughout the ASR practices is used to 
represent the organization which processes a customer's request for 
service in an access or local provider offering such access services.

NOTE 1:
If the disconnect of a Leg(s)on an existing
multipoint configuration causes it to change to a 
two point configuration two ASRs may be required
depending on provider procedures. If two ASRs are
required one would contain an ACT of “D” and the
other “N”. Use of the RPON field along with remarks
would be necessary in an effort to be sure that

NOTE 4:
Provider Access Tariffs/practices define the
allowable set of changes that can be accommodated
on this Supplement Type. 
NOTE 5:
In a Multi-EC environment the use of a SUP type
“3” is to be based on the status of the ASC-EC FOC.
Since an OEC FOC status may not necessarily 
match the ASC-EC FOC status OECs must be able
to accept SUP type “3” regardless of FOC status
when the ASC-EC field is populated. 
NOTE 6:
Used when an OEC is added to or deleted from the
Multi-EC Form. Therefore when the ASC-EC field is
populated with an ICSC code other than that of the
receiving provider the receipt of a SUP “3” must be
acceptable as the initial ASR to the added OEC.

when the ASC-EC field is populated. 
NOTE 4:
Used when an OEC is added to or deleted from the
Multi-EC Form. When the ASC-EC field is populated

(QTY=7). 
NOTE 7:
A multipoint circuit is considered to be one circuit.
Only 1 multipoint circuit may be requested per
Access Service Request as interpreted herein.
